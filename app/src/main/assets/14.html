<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before leaving the resident&rsquo;s room, it is important to ask these 3 questions:&nbsp;</span>
<br><br>

    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you need to use the bathroom right now?</span></li><br>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?</span></li><br>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you need me to do anything for you before I leave your room?</span></li><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answers obtained can offer information about the patient&rsquo;s needs and what they intend to do in the
        near future.&nbsp;</span>
