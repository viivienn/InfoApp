<span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are very different from one another in age, life expectancy, health
        condition, and cognition levels.&nbsp;</span><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents are in the end stage of their
            lives&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if some may not communicate as much or as easily,
            it is important to talk with them every day</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some residents have no cognitive impairment, while
            others are deeply affected by them</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents in long term care facilities that are on the
            younger side may have conditions that decrease their physical abilities, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or
            amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig&rsquo;s disease)</span></li>
