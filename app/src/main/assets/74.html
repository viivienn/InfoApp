<span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents with cognitive impairments may have:</span>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties following instructions and orders</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties performing daily tasks, such as brushing
            their hair, washing their hands, etc.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties with memory and attention</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decrease in enthusiasm or initiative</span></li><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We must take these difficulties into consideration when we communicate with these
        residents:</span>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When giving instructions, make sure to dictate one
            step at a time. Avoid giving the instructions all at one, because the resident might have difficulties
            remembering.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The instructions must be simple. Use
        </span><strong>simpler words</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if possible.</span></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, the resident is physically able to
                perform the movement, but is unable to understand what they are supposed to do.&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to adapt the level of difficulty of the
            tasks to the resident&rsquo;s abilities.</span></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Demonstrate the action</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed to
                be done to ensure their comprehension. By doing so, the resident will accomplish what is asked of them,
                which can increase their self-esteem.&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the resident is able to participate in their daily
            tasks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, provide supervision discreetly</span></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sends the message that you trust their
                abilities to complete a task.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the resident is unable to complete their task,
                calmly intervene</span></li>
    </ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Validate the resident&rsquo;s needs and emotions by
            repeating what they just said</span></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you do not understand what the resident
                tried to express, repeating what they just said can help reduce the resident&rsquo;s anxiety</span></li>
    </ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ðŸ’¡ <span style="color: #3366ff;">Important: remember to always </span></span><span
        style="font-weight: 400; color: #3366ff;">speak to residents with respect</span><span
        style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"> and not show any forms of impatience when they are
            struggling with their tasks or taking a lot of time</span>&nbsp;</span></p>
