<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before leaving the resident&rsquo;s room, it is important to ask these 3 questions:</span></h3>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Do you need to use the bathroom right now?</li>
<li>Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort?</li>
<li>Do you need me to do anything for you before I leave your room?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ðŸ’¡ The answers obtained can offer information about the patient&rsquo;s needs and intentions in the near future!&nbsp;</p>
