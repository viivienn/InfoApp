   <br>
   <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain patient and provide reassurance when
            communicating with a resident.</span>
        <ul style="margin:0;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat yourself if the resident does not
                    understand what you are trying to say</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid any kind of confrontation or disagreement with a resident. Avoid
            interrupting the resident, especially to correct something they said.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <ul style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, validate their emotions and what they are
                saying</span></li>
    </ul><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay attention to any verbal and non-verbal signs that
            can give you an idea of what the resident wants. This can help prevent potential distress behavior from the
            resident.</span></li><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many residents can become confused as they have been
            spending their time in their room for many weeks. There are certain questions you can ask to help orient
            them:</span>
        <ul style="margin:0;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What day is it today?</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the weather like outside?</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did you sleep last night?</span></li>
            <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did you eat today?</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DO NOT</span> speak in a high pitched tone
            resembling a voice you would use with a young child&nbsp;</span></li><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DO NOT</span> use
            inappropriate terms of endearment, such as honey or sweetheart</span></li><br>

ðŸ’¡ <span style="color: #3366ff;">Remember to always speak to residents with respect and to not undermine their
        intelligence, including residents with cognitive difficulties</span><br><br>

<strong>To establish contact with the resident:</strong><br><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introduce yourself when you are entering the
            room</span></li><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residents are addressed as they wish: e.g. first name,
            Mr., Ms. or Mrs</span></li><br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Establish adequate eye contact to capture the
            resident&rsquo;s attention&nbsp;</span>
        <ul style="margin:0;">
            <li style="font-weight: 400; list-style: 'ðŸ’¡';"><span style="color: #3366ff;">&nbsp;Ensure the resident can
                    see, hear, and understand what you are saying</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li><br>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Explain the reason for your visit clearly: using simple words and speaking
            calmly</span></li>
<ul style="margin:0;">
        <li><strong>Obtain the resident&rsquo;s consent prior to your interventions&nbsp;</strong></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may ask if they&rsquo;re comfortable, if
                everything is alright, if they need anything</span></li>
    </ul>
