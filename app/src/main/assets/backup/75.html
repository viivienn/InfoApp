<br>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If the resident is acting anxious or distrustful:</strong></span><br><br>
<ol style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">DO NOT</span> try to
                        reason or to discuss with the resident</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempt to distract the resident by changing the
                        subject of the conversation to something they like or by proposing to do an activity that is
                        enjoyable for them</span></li>
</ol>
<br><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:&nbsp;</span><br>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the resident has a picture of their family in
                        their room, ask for the names of the people that are in the photo</span></li>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the resident usually enjoys crossword puzzles,
                        give them a puzzle to complete and come back later to finish your tasks</span></li>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ðŸ’¡<span style="color: #3366ff;"> Do not take the resident&rsquo;s mistrust or harsh
                        words personally</span>&nbsp;</span></p><br>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>If the resident is being violent or aggressive:</strong>&nbsp;</span><br><br>
<ol style="margin:0;">
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the first signs of aggressivity, if the
                        resident is not in any danger of falling, stop what you are doing to allow the resident to
                        regain their calm&nbsp;</span>
                <ul style="margin:0;">
                        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can take from a few seconds
                                        up to a few minutes</span></li>
                </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remain calm and keep reassuring the resident</span></li><br>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the resident is not at risk of falling or in a
                        medical emergency, ensure to leave them enough personal space. Leave the room if
                        needed.&nbsp;</span></li><br>
        <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the event, attempt to recall potential
                        phrases or actions that might have caused the resident to become aggressive to prevent the same
                        situation from happening again in the future</span></li>
