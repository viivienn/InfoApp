The SafeTrained app is designed to enhance learning for assistants of the orderlies and new hires of long-term care facilities. Being aware of the ongoing staffing and time constraints, our goal is to provide easily accessible information and resources on an interactive platform to ensure patient and staff safety. 

All the information created has been split into 7 comprehensive modules that each include specific sub-modules, as well as a list of key points and a quiz to ensure the material is properly understood. We also offer a glossary with key words that can be easily referenced. For those who would like to access the PDF version, all of the information has been placed on a drive in the document link of the Settings page.

The application was developed by ETS student Vivien Chow and the content was written and translated by Selma Bannour, Cindy Chow, Cindy Guo, Celine Tran, Jonathan-Hao Tran, MSc. Occupational Therapy students at McGill University. The project is supervised by Occupational Therapist, Karen Falccichio and verified by Perrine Peckre, OT at CIUSSS de l'Ouest-de-l'Île and Pamela Scher, OT at Vigi Santé of West Island.
